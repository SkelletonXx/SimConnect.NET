A modern, high-performance C# wrapper for Microsoft Flight Simulator's SimConnect SDK. It simplifies flight simulation development by providing async/await patterns and high-level abstractions, enabling real-time aircraft data monitoring, AI object management, and seamless integration with the simulator through a clean, type-safe API.

> **⚠️ Beta Software Notice**  
> SimConnect.NET is currently in beta development. APIs may change, features may be added or removed, and breaking changes are expected between releases. Use in production environments at your own discretion and always test thoroughly before deploying.
